# Robot Puzzle Solver

A computer vision system that automatically solves jigsaw puzzles using webcam input and advanced image processing techniques.

## What It Does

This project provides an automated puzzle-solving assistant that can:
- **Detect puzzle pieces** in real-time from webcam feed
- **Match pieces** to their correct positions using shape analysis
- **Guide users** through puzzle assembly with visual feedback
- **Support multiple puzzle sizes** (12-piece and 24-piece puzzles)
- **Provide live solving mode** for continuous assistance

The system uses computer vision algorithms to analyze puzzle piece shapes, calculate their orientations, and match them to pre-computed solution data.

## How It Works

### Core Components

1. **Camera Calibration** (`puzzle_capture.py`)
   - Calibrates the webcam to correct perspective distortion
   - Allows manual selection of puzzle boundary corners
   - Saves calibration data to `configs/config.json`

2. **Piece Detection** (`detect_pieces.py`)
   - Processes puzzle images to identify individual pieces
   - Uses contour analysis and morphological operations
   - Computes Hu moments for shape matching
   - Calculates centroids and orientations
   - Outputs piece data in JSON format (`configs/Puzzle_N.json`)

3. **Live Solving** (`puzzle_solver.py`)
   - GUI application built with CustomTkinter
   - Real-time webcam capture and processing
   - Piece detection and matching using Hungarian algorithm
   - Interactive hover feedback showing target positions
   - Live mode for continuous puzzle assistance

### Technical Approach

The system employs several computer vision techniques:

- **Perspective Transformation**: Corrects camera angle distortion
- **Contour Detection**: Identifies piece boundaries using edge detection
- **Shape Descriptors**: Hu moments provide rotation-invariant shape matching
- **Assignment Problem**: Hungarian algorithm optimally matches detected pieces to solution
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for live webcam input at 30+ FPS

### Data Flow

```
Webcam Feed → Perspective Transform → Piece Detection → Shape Matching → Solution Display
     ↓              ↓                      ↓              ↓              ↓
  Raw Frame    Corrected View        Contours      Hu Moments    Target Positions
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- CustomTkinter
- SciPy (for Hungarian algorithm)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotpuzzle.git
   cd robotpuzzle
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy customtkinter scipy
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Solution Data

First, create solution data for your puzzle:

```bash
python detect_pieces.py path/to/solved_puzzle_image.png 24
```

This generates `configs/Puzzle_24.json` with piece data.

### 2. Calibrate Camera

```bash
python puzzle_capture.py
```

- Press 'c' to capture a frame
- Click the 4 corners of your puzzle area
- Press 's' to save calibration

### 3. Solve Puzzles

Launch the GUI solver:

```bash
python puzzle_solver.py
```

- Select puzzle size (12 or 24 pieces)
- Click "Calibrate Camera" if needed
- Click "Capture & Solve" for single-shot solving
- Use "Start Live Mode" for continuous assistance

## Algorithm Details

### Piece Matching

Pieces are matched using Hu moment invariants, which are:
- **Translation invariant**: Position doesn't affect matching
- **Scale invariant**: Size differences are normalized
- **Rotation invariant**: Shape matching works regardless of orientation

The Hungarian algorithm ensures optimal assignment of detected pieces to solution positions.

### Orientation Calculation

Piece orientation uses moment-based analysis of filled contours, providing robust angle estimation even for irregular shapes.
